# Tic-Tac-Toe

# About the game

This project has been created in the first module at Ironhack SÃ£o Paulo - Web development Bootcamp

## How it works

**1.**  The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

**2.**  Players take turns putting their marks **X or O** in empty squares.

**3.**  The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

**4.**  When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
